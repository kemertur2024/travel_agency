    "question1": "How can I book a tour?",
    "answer1": "Fill out the application form at the bottom of the page (booking without prepayment!). Our operator will contact you within an hour. You can also write to us on WhatsApp, Viber, or Telegram.",
    "question2": "How is the tour paid for?",
    "answer2": "Payment is made in cash during the tour, preferably in dollars or euros. Online payment via Sberbank, Kaspi, or in USDT is also possible. Important: tours to Istanbul must be paid for in advance (100%) due to the need to purchase flight tickets. A deposit is required for private tours and yacht rentals.",
    "question3": "Why are our prices lower than those of tour operators?",
    "answer3": "Foreign tour operators are not legally allowed to organize tours in Turkey and must use the services of local agencies. This increases the price, as each intermediary adds their own markup. With us, you pay directly, bypassing all intermediaries, which makes the price about twice as low.",
    "question4": "Can I change the tour date?",
    "answer4": "If the tour does not include a flight ticket, you can change the date no later than a day before the tour. To change the date or tour, simply contact us via WhatsApp or Viber. If the tour includes a flight ticket (e.g., Istanbul or Israel), the date cannot be changed due to pre-purchased tickets.",
    "question5": "Is insurance valid if I go on a tour with you?",
    "answer5": "Yes, insurance is valid. Your travel insurance, arranged in your home country, covers all of Turkey, regardless of where you book the tour. Additionally, all tours are further insured by the organizing company, according to Turkish law.",
    "question6": "Where should I wait for the bus for the tour?",
    "answer6": "On the specified date and time, please wait for the bus at the exit of your hotel (outside the gate)."
