Pamukkale (which translates from Turkish as 'cotton castle') is a natural site that includes 17 geothermal springs with water temperatures ranging from 35 to 100 degrees, as well as pools with dazzling white terraces formed from travertine (calcium-rich limestone). This place and the ancient city of Hierapolis have been considered a resort for Roman nobility since the 1st century. The first structures of Hierapolis date back to the 2nd millennium BC. However, the city named Hierapolis was built in 190 BC by King Eumenes II of Pergamon. In 133 BC, the city came under Roman rule. In the early 1st century AD, Hierapolis gained fame among the Roman aristocracy as a spa center with the natural springs of Pamukkale. From this moment, the city's prosperity began. Our tour will cover the entire Pamukkale-Hierapolis area with visits to all significant sites (travertines, ancient theater, Temple of Apollo, necropolis). All who wish can also bathe in Cleopatra's baths (ancient pool).\n\n**Additionally:**\n\n+ $100 transfer from Belek\n\n+ $15 visit to Cleopatra's baths\n\n+ $50 visit to the Turkish Maldives ‚Äì Lake Salda",

(Check with the manager).\n\n**Price:** from 1 to 9 people\n\nThis place you might have seen in almost all promotional brochures about vacations in Turkey. The beach is located under a steep cliff and is famous for its green and turquoise water. You can even see a clear boundary between these colors. After an interesting excursion and a walk around the town of Kas, you will have about 2 hours of free time to enjoy this beautiful beach.\n\n**Main features of Kaputas Beach:**\n\n- **Beach type:** Sand + Fine pebbles\n- **Water entry:** Gradual\n- **Beach length:** 200 m\n- **Beach width:** Wide\n- **Crowdedness:** High\n\n**Beach features:**\nLike many beaches in Turkey, Kaputas is framed by steep cliffs. To descend to the shore, you need to overcome about two hundred steps. The staircase is not steep, convenient, but still quite long for descent with a stroller. Climbing, especially in the heat, is even more challenging.\n\n**Infrastructure, dining, and safety:**\nPopular tourist beaches outside the resorts are sometimes wild, but Kaputas is not one of those. It has all the essentials for a comfortable stay: sunbed and umbrella rentals, several changing cabins, showers, and toilets. Visitors note that sunbed rentals here are more expensive than on many beaches in Turkey. However, you can set up a free mat (if there is space ‚Äì in season the bay is crowded with vacationers). Using changing rooms, toilets, and showers is free for everyone. On such a small stretch of beach, there is only one caf√©. It doesn‚Äôt have a full menu; you can expect coffee, tea, soft drinks, and ice cream. Occasionally, locals sell flatbreads and other street food on the beach. It‚Äôs more reliable to bring your own food and water with you to this beach. There is no regular lifeguard service at Kaputas, which is one reason why the beach does not have a 'Blue Flag'. However, vacationers say that during the high season, lifeguards do patrol the shore.\n\n**Kaputas Beach Infrastructure:**\n- Sunbeds\n- Umbrellas\n- Changing cabins\n- Showers\n- Toilets\n- Caf√©\n\n**What to bring:**\n- Comfortable footwear (flip-flops)\n- Swimwear\n- Sunscreen\n- Towel\n- Money for personal expenses",

The history of Antalya began long before the birth of Christ. In 159 BC, Pergamene King Attalos II from the Greek Attalid dynasty founded a new port city at the edge of his kingdom. The city was named after King Attalos. However, just 29 years later, the entire Pergamene kingdom came under Roman control, and the development of the city slowed down for a while. In the 2nd century AD, at the peak of the Roman Empire, Antalya and the entire Antalya region flourished. A walk through the Old Town is a journey through different eras from Ancient Rome, Byzantium, the Ottoman era, to the establishment of modern Turkey. In Kalei√ßi, we will visit all the significant and symbolic places of old Antalya (such as the Yivli Minaret, Hadrian's Gate, Hidirlik Tower, and Byzantine churches), stroll through narrow Eastern streets, visit the old port, and also check out shops with the best Turkish delight in Antalya.
